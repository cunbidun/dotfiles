Hi Duy,

Your 30 minute phone interview is confirmed! The interviewer will call you at the scheduled time at 413-313-9462. As a reminder, the coding phone interview will focus on computer science knowledge and coding experience. There will be a segment of the interview that includes a codepair exercise, so having a computer available is crucial. The link to the codepair portal will be sent within one business day of the interview. It may take our interviewer a few minutes to set up, so please be patient if they do not call until a few minutes after the scheduled time.

If this time no longer works for you, please email me, Troy Pepicelli, at Troy.Pepicelli@twosigma.com.

Thanks,

Troy
